\section{Evidence for Dark Matter}




\subsection{Galactic Scale}

Dark matter was named as a solution to an inconsitancy in galactic rotation curves.

Hydrogen spectral lines were studied from various places in different galaxies.
From these spectral lines, doppler shifts could be used to calculate the radial velocity of that area of the galaxy.
By comparing the radial velocities at different distances from the visible center of galaxies, a profile can be created that charts the enclosed mass.

Alternately, star formation can be simulated, which can be used to predict the amount of light seen for each solar mass in a region.
From this second method, the mass contained in a galaxy can also be measured at each radial distance from the galaxy's center.

By comparing these two mass curves, it has been found that they differ greatly.
Thus, the concept of dark matter was invented to make up for the discrepancy between these two curves.

\subsection{Cluster Scales}

Dark Matter is viewed as the seed for where galaxy clusters form in the universe.

\subsection{Universe Scale}

Due to how the universe formed, the missing matter is not percieved to be locked up in baryons.

\section{Detection Techniques}

There are three general methods of search for dark matter particles.
Direct Detection experiments attempt to discern when a dark matter particle directly strikes a volume of detection mass, stored deep underground.
Indirect Detection experiments attempt to look for secondary products of dark matter interactions, usually through astrophysical searchs.
Collider searches attempt to produce a dark matter particle through controlled collisions of standard model particles.
