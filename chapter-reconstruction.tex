\chapter{Gamma Ray Reconstruction}

\section{Sky Direction}
image cleaning
hillas fitting
image intersection

\section{Energy Reconstruction}
table lookup via shower size and distance

\section{Effective Area}

simulate events
spawn events in area
measure number that fall within the area

\section{Acceptance}
radial acceptance, fill gamma-like events to histogram

\section{Background}
fill gamma-like events to 2d histogram

\section{Point Spread Function}
spawn events at a single point, look at reconstructed distribution

\section{Energy Dispersion}
spawn events at single energy, look at reconstructed distribution

\section{FROGS Method}
template method for fitting showers, improves energy resolution

\section{DISP Method}
tweaks how image intersections are weighted, improved psf at low elevations.

\section{BDT Method}
supervised learning algorithm for sorting gammas and protons, good for extended sources
