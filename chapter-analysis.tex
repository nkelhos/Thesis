\section{Likelihood Ratio Test}
The likelihood ratio test useful for comparing two hypotheses.
They are referred to as the null and alternative hypotheses.
Each hypothesis consists of a predicted number of events at each point in the energy/space/time parameter space.
Once each hypothesis is constructed, the likelihood for each can be computed.
The ratio of the two likelihoods then follows a gaussian (with certain assumptions), meaning the sigificance of the alternative hypothesis over the null can be calculated.
