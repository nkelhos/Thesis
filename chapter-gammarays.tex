\chapter{Gamma Rays}

\section{Methods of Creation}

\subsection{Leptonic Processes}
Electrons up-scatter ambient photons into higher-energy gamma rays.

\subsection{Hadronic Processes}
High energy protons collide with other protons, decay into pions, and neutral pions decay into gamma-ray pairs.

\subsection{Radioactive Decay}
Heavy atoms decay into lower-mass particles, sometimes emitting gamma rays.
Orders of magnitude lower energy than the ones VERITAS detects.

\subsection{Dark Matter Interactions}
Indirect Detection: dark-dark => sm-sm
Direct Detection  : dark-sm => dark-sm
Collider Detection: sm-sm => dark-dark


\section{Atmospheric Shower}

Gamma rays strike atmospheric molecules, and produce an $e^\pm$ pair.
The $e^+$ quickly annihilates into a $\gamma$ pair, which then repeate the process.
the $e^-$ travels futher, collides with an existing particle, knocking more electrons free from atmospheric molecules.
These electrons (still posessing a large amount of energy) then go on to knock more electrons free, repeating the cycle.

As these electrons pass through the atmosphere, the are traveling at some velocity $c_{atmo}<v_e<c_{vac}$.
This means they produce cherenkov light, at an angle proportional to their velocity and the local speed of light.


\section{Astrophysical Events}

\subsection{Jets}
Generally, anything with mass falling into a well produces a jet.

\subsection{Cloud-Cloud Interactions}
2 clouds of particles pass through, some interact and produce gamma rays.
proton-proton, electron-photon, etc

\subsection{Other things?}

\section{Galactic Center}

The galactic center is a complex region of space, with many astrophysical sources of gamma rays.
A disk of dust lies along the galactic plane, acting as an interaction medium for diffuse proton cosmic rays.
Nearby supernova remnants also produce gamma-rays as their expanding shell interacts with ambient dust.
The immediate area surrounding the galactic center a point-source emitter of gamma rays, though this mechanism is uncertain.

\subsection{Supermassive Black Hole}

Through kinematic observations of nearby stars, the galactic center is suspected to have a black hole, on the order of $10^6 M_{\odot}$. ??

\subsection{Diffuse Emission}
The disk of gas that permeates the galactic plane acts as an interaction medium for passing cosmic rays, both from galactic accelerators, as well as from extragalactic sources.
These high-energy protons collide with the dust, shattering into $\pi^{\pm,0}$.
The $\pi^0$ then decays into two gamma rays ??, providing the diffuse emission.
The spectrum of this emission is ??.
