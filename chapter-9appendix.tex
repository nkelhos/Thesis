\chapter{Effect of Stars}\label{app:starpixels}

  Understanding the camera's background is important for accurately modeling extended sources like dark matter halos.
  The camera's background shape is due to the performance of many individual camera pixels working together.
  VERITAS on-site operators had, in the past, noted that for apparent visible magnitude \SIrange{6}{8} stars, the camera pixels they illuminated would have a higher average current.
  This causes higher pedestal variations in the affected pixels, which decrease how often the pixel participated in shower images.
  In addition, if a star with $m_V < 6$ was in the field of view, it would cause a high enough current in the pixel to trigger a safety system that lowers its voltage to zero, to prevent it from being damaged.
  For particularly bright stars, such as $m_V \leq 3$, several pixels can be disabled at any given time.

  Compounding this effect is that, since the telescope camera is fixed to the ground, the sky rotates around the camera center.
  This means that over a single 30 minute observation the field of view rotates around the camera center, and each star in view disables successive camera pixels as it passes over them.
  The camera rechecks these disabled pixels roughly once per minute by turning their voltage back on and monitoring the current, and resetting it to zero if the current is still above the threshold.

  These effects imply that to study the effect of stars, one must study the effect of high-current and disabled camera pixels, and use this information to construct the effect of stars.
  In the following section, the effects of disabled camera pixels are studied.

\section{Effects of Disabled Pixels}

% see calculations/disabledpixel_obstime , those 250 crab runs turned into about 13.5 observation hours
To examine the effects of disabled pixels, \nicetilde13 hours of Crab Nebula observations were reconstructed twice.
The first analysis was with the default analysis chain settings, and the second time with a single pixel disabled in all four telescopes.
This mimics the effect of having a star in the field of view that is bright enough to disable a pixel.
The purpose of this study is to examine how many events are lost due to a dead pixel.
If there are bright stars near the Galactic Center, or a large number of disabled pixels in the data, the telescopes would be less sensitive to any dark matter halo.

After gamma-hadron cuts are applied to both sets of events, studies can be performed on events that only appeared in one set and not the other.
Some events may only pass gamma-hadron cuts with the pixel enabled ($P_e$), while others only pass when the pixel is disabled ($P_d$).
Events that are present when the pixel is both enabled and disabled can also be tested to see how far their reconstructed position moved in the camera.

In Figure~\ref{fig:dpix_rel_camera}, the relative event rate in the camera is plotted when pixel 115 is disabled in all four telescopes.
This relative event rate is calculated by binning all $P_d$ and $P_e$ events by their reconstructed position in camera coordinates.
Then, for each camera coordinate bin, the ratio of the number of events $\frac{P_d}{P_e}$ is calculated.
As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:dpix_rel_camera}, there is a loss of events near the disabled pixel (the black circle), with a rate closer to 100\% the farther one goes from the disabled pixel.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    It should be noted that squares in this plot are showing the reconstructed positions of events, which can be resolved to positions smaller than one PMT pixel.
  }
  \label{fig:dpix_rel_camera}
\end{figure}

When these bins are combined radially around the disabled pixel, a clear loss of events is visible in Figure~\ref{fig:dpix_rel_radial}.
From this, it can be seen that at \ang{0.1} from the disabled pixel, the relative event rate is almost 7\% lower than when the pixel was enabled.
From an area-weighted average of all bins within \ang{0.33} of a pixel, the average event rate is approximately 3.1\% lower than when the pixel is enabled.
Over the entire field of view, disabling one pixel in all four telescopes resulted in 0.7\% fewer events (14900 events vs 15010 per average \SI{20}{minute} observation).

% Sgr A* Off runs:  28813pixmin/ 2458631pixmin = 1.172%

While this single-pixel loss-of-events effect was notable, it was also quite small.
This was because for the Galactic Center analyzed in this thesis, there were relatively few disabled pixels.
For the three observing targets described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:analysis}, the amount of time pixels spent disabled was calculated.
The Crab Nebula observations had a total of 2,245,377 pixel-minutes, while 37,701 pixel-minutes were lost due to pixels being disabled, about 1.68\%.
This 1.68\% equates to a loss of 8.4 pixels (out of 499) in each telescope for the duration of an observation.
For the Sgr A* Off data, the loss rate was lower at 1.17\%, equivalent to losing 5.8 pixels in each telescope.
For Sgr A*, 0.88\% of pixel-minutes were lost, equivalent to losing 4.4 pixels in each telescope.

As these disabled pixels are mostly caused by bright stars, a search of bright stars near each observing source may shed some light on why the Crab Nebula loses 1.6\% of its pixels, while Sgr A* and Sgr A* Off lose less.
Table~\ref{tab:brightstars} shows the brightest stars near each observing source brighter than V${}_{mag}<6.5$.
While the Crab Nebula has several bright stars including HIP26451 with V${}_{mag} = 2.97$, Sgr A* Off and Sgr A* only have dimmer stars (V${}_{mag}$ 4.28 and 4.53, respectively).
Since one pixel disabled in all telescopes resulted in 0.7\% fewer events, and the Sgr A* observations in this analysis have \nicetilde{}4.4 pixels disabled, a rough estimate for the events lost due to stars near Sgr A* is approximately 3\%.
Crab Nebula observations, with 8.4 lost pixels, lose approximately 5.9\% of its events.
Note however, that the majority of these event losses are not gamma rays from the observing target, but are instead lost background events near (<\ang{0.5}) the position of the stars that disabled pixels.
There are several situations where a gamma ray source's flux could be underestimated due to this effect.
These include:
\begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$,noitemsep]
  \item when a gamma-ray source transits near a visible-spectrum star, or visa versa;
  \item when a gamma-ray source also emits visible-spectrum photons.
\end{itemize}
Due to the scarcity of bright ($V_{mag}<3$) visible stars and bright gamma-ray sources, this syzygy is extremely rare.

In Figure~\ref{fig:dpix_disappear}, the positions of events that were rejected by cuts are shown.
The white area indicates many events are lost in the area of the disabled pixel.
These events would have smaller images, and would be much more susceptible to being cut.

  \caption[Events That Disappear when Disabling Camera Pixels]{

  \label{fig:dpix_disappear}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:dpix_appear}, the positions of events that are now able to pass cuts are shown.
It should be noted that these are not events that were 'created' by disabling a pixel.
Rather, they are events that, with the pixel enabled, did not pass cuts.
Now that the pixel is disabled, they do pass cuts.

What is also noticeable is that the highest concentration of lost events was in the pixel's area, whereas the highest rate for appearing events is actually in a ring with a radius of \nicetilde1.5 pixels around the disabled pixel.
This is probably due to the fact that disabling a pixel can make some images look thinner or wider, depending on where the disabled pixel is in the image.
A thinner image will look more gamma-like, making it more likely to pass cuts.
On the other hand, a wider image looks more hadron-like, and is less likely to pass cuts, causing some events to disappear.

  \label{fig:dpix_appear}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:dpix_move}, the movement of gamma-like events is shown, when pixel 115 was disabled in all four telescopes.
Only events which moved more than 10\% of the PSF are shown.
It should be noted that relatively few (0.7\%, or 117 out of the 15010 events in an average 20-minute long Crab Nebula run) move more than this, and the events that do move are mostly ones with non-compact image shapes that are amputated when a pixel is disabled.

What can be learned from this is that a negligibly small number of events disappear when a pixel is disabled.
Unexpectedly, disabled pixels also have an impact on events' reconstructed positions, even on the far side of the camera.
This may imply that the gamma-ray PSF depends, at least to second order, on the number and pattern of disabled pixels, though no studies were done to confirm this.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/disabled_pixel/moving_events}

  \label{fig:dpix_move}
\end{figure}

As the acceptance for a particular event and the event's effective area are strongly related, the loss of acceptance also means a loss of effective area near the pixel.
This can have effects on the energy reconstruction.
Additionally, for CTA and its projected \ang{7} diameter field of view, more stars will be in the field of view, implying there will be more camera pixels affected by their light.

\textbf{An important concept to learn from these studies is that the PMTs in the camera work together as a whole to reconstruct events, and the loss of one PMT can affect the reconstruction of events anywhere else in the camera.}
These studies show the loss of a single pixel does not significantly reduce the overall event rate, but does decrease the event rate by \nicetilde{}3\% near (<\ang{0.3}) the position of stars that are brighter than magnitude 6.5.
For the Galactic Center, only 1\% of the pixels are disabled, equivalent to 5 pixels in each telescope on average.
% 2320620 disabled pixelseconds out of 214657920 total pixelseconds in the Sgr A* runlist
% 2320620 / 214657920 = 0.0108 fraction of time lost
% 499 * 0.0108 = 5.38 pixels in each telescope
% see $VERIPY/thesis/analysis/find_dead_pixels_near_GC/find.py
Because this study indicates the number of events lost is small, and there are relatively few dead pixels in the Galactic Center's field of view, the effect of dead pixels was ignored in the dark matter search.

Another reason these disabled pixels are not accounted for is that they are dwarfed by a much larger issue.
The atmospheric gradient has a much larger effect on the background than the disabled-pixel effect.
This is discussed further in Chapter~\ref{chapter:analysis}.
Future analyses may be able to account for these effects in their models of the background rates and effective areas.

Future studies could also compare how events move in energy when a pixel is disabled.
Another study might investigate how the reconstructed shower-telescope distance changes, since a shower with fewer pixels will look farther away, and may be reconstructed differently.
Another possibility is that, for VERITAS or future CTA observations where pixels are disabled (either due to stars or maintenance), customized background models can be constructed that account for the specific configuration of disabled pixels.
Since the disabled pixel information (which pixels and the disable/enable times) is saved as part of regular observation monitoring, this can be used to apply Gaussian-shaped event-rate penalties to any background models.
In general, when a pixel is disabled, it is expected that lower energy events and showers further away will be more vulnerable, and will show stronger differences than higher energy events or closer showers.



\chapter{Residual Sky Map Significance Distributions}\label{app:sigdist}

\section{Bin Significance Calculation}
The likelihood analyses in Chapter~\ref{chapter:analysis} fit a series of models to two sets of data.
The models in these analyses were chosen from using results from previous studies.
However, these models may not perfectly match the sources.
To check for any poorly modeled areas of the sky, the difference between the observed counts and models can be examined.
While a simple residual may provide some insight, it is far better to calculate how significantly the observed counts ($D$) and modeled counts ($M$) differ in different parts of the sky.

This significance is derived through a likelihood calculation.
Two hypotheses are constructed, the null and the test.
The null hypothesis is that the model alone is enough to explain the number of observed events.
The test hypothesis is that the number of observed events is from the model plus an unknown component.
For each bin, the probability of each hypothesis is calculated with Poissonian statistics via

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:sig_hypo}
  \begin{split}
    P_{\textrm{null}} & = \frac{M^{D} e^{-M}}{D!} \\
    P_{\textrm{test}} & = \frac{D^{D} e^{-D}}{D!} \,.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
As this is for a single bin, the likelihood of each hypothesis is just these probabilities:
  
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    L_{\textrm{null}} & = P_{\textrm{null}} \\
    L_{\textrm{test}} & = P_{\textrm{test}} \,.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Then a test statistic is calculated with these two likelihood hypotheses, via

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \textrm{TS} & = 2 \: \textrm{ln} \left ( \frac{ L_{\textrm{test}} }{ L_{\textrm{null}}    } \right ) \\
                & = 2 \: \textrm{ln} \left ( \frac{ P_{\textrm{test}} }{ P_{\textrm{null}}    } \right ) \\
                & = 2 \: \textrm{ln} \left ( \frac{D^D e^{-D}}{D!} \times \frac{D!}{M^D e^{-M}} \right ) \\
                & = 2 \: \textrm{ln} \left ( D^D e^{-D} M^{-D} e^M                              \right ) \\
                & = 2 \: \left (      \textrm{ln} \left ( D^D M^{-D} \right ) + \textrm{ln} \left ( e^{-D} \right ) + \textrm{ln} \left ( e^M  \right )\right ) \\
                & = 2 \: \left (      \textrm{ln} \left (  \frac{D^D}{M^D} \right ) -D + M \right ) \\
    \textrm{TS} & = 2 \: \left ( D \: \textrm{ln} \left (  \frac{D  }{M  } \right ) -D + M \right ) \,.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
  
Then, by utilizing Wilk's theorem~\cite{wilks1938} with one extra degree of freedom, and accounting for the sign, the significance can be calculated with
  
\begin{equation}
  \textrm{Significance} = \sqrt{\textrm{TS}} \times \textrm{sign} \left ( D - M \right ) \,.
\end{equation}
This leads to the significance of a bin's residual,

% see http://cta.irap.omp.eu/ctools/users/reference_manual/csresmap.html
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:resmap_signif2}
  \textrm{Significance} = \textrm{sign}(D-M) \times \sqrt{ 2 \left ( D \: \textrm{ln} \left ( \frac{D}{M} \right ) + M - D \right ) } \,.
\end{equation}

%This non-Gaussian distribution occurs because of how the significance is calculated.
%In the significance calculation, a Poissonian variable is being input into Equation~\ref{eqn:resmap_signif2}.
%A Gaussian distribution is symmetric about the mean, while the Poisson probability distribution is not symmetric about the mean at low averages.
%If the average modeled number of counts is low (i.e. $<50$), the distribution drifts away from a Gaussian shape.
%One way to lower the number of counts in a bin is by reducing the size of the bin.

%This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:various_sig_dists}, where four models with different average number of events per bin are simulated.
%Each of the four models is sampled in \SI{1000000} bins, where the model in each bin is randomly varied uniformly by $\pm 75\%$.
%This shows that the significance calculation does follow a true significance distribution when the average number of events in each bin is high (the lower right plot).
%At lower average counts per bin, however, simulations must be used with a residual to see if any areas in the sky map show significant difference between data and models.
