	* Version 2.0 released.

	* hepparticles.pdf/.tex documentation updated to v2.

	* Remove pdflatex exclusion from \to spacing modification.

2014-07-15  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding \@shiftlen@norm@con@rmsub and other macros to allow
	customization of particle bar, tilde and sub/super-script
	horizontal corrections without hacking the style file. In general
	these corrections will be font-specific.

	* Remove \HepTo macro -- surely no-one was using it? Just use \to

2014-07-08  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Italic kerning corrections now applied (in a sf/rm-dependent
	way) to overlines and tildes, making them more appropriately
	aligned with the underlying symbol.

	* Remove the sans and force-italic package options -- sans context
	will now always be used (why would it not?) and mathit style is
	applied in all italic or slanted shape contexts.

	* Rewrite to use subdepth to get uniform subscript and superscript
	heights and to use the font specification much more intelligently
	-- this is now done without using the maybemath package.

	* Replacing use of \maybebm with Donald Arseneau's trick to append
	\boldmath to the \bfseries definition.

2005-07-28  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@durham.ac.uk>

	* Remove \mspace from hyperref labels in PDFTeX and provide
	alternative form ("to ") for \HepTo and \to. Thanks to
	Heiko Oberdiek and Donald Arseneau for providing the solution
	via comp.text.tex.

	* Tidying/removal of the redundant documentation in the
	hepparticles.sty file.

2005-02-22  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@durham.ac.uk>

	* Version 1.4 released: much more flexible symbol construction
	model. Note syntax changes have been required and the package
	will not be backwards compatible. The current syntax should be
	stable.

2004-12-02  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@durham.ac.uk>

	* First public version released.
