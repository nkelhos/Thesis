VERITAS is an arrary of four Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, each spaced $\nicetilde50m$ apart.
Each telescope possesses an array of 345 mirrors, and a 499-Photomultiplier-Tube camera out on a set of four struts, called quads.
Each mirror focuses photons onto the camera.
In Section \ref{sec:hardware}, the different hardware components are discussed.
In Section \ref{sec:trig}, the different trigger levels are discussed.
The methods for image reconstruction are discussed in Section \ref{sec:imgrecon}.
In Section \ref{sec:recon}, the reconstruction used in different parts of the analysis are discussed, including the per-telescope image reconstruction in Subsection \ref{subsec:imgrecon}, the direction reconstruction in Subsection \ref{subsec:posrecon}, and the energy reconstruction in Subsection \ref{subsec:enrecon}.


\section{Hardware}\label{sec:hardware}
When a gamma-ray produces an air shower in the atmosphere, the shower emits numerous Cherenkov photons, over a time period of nanoseconds.
When the light from the shower reaches the telescopes, only a handful of Cherenkov photons remain, and these photons are spread out over several nanoseconds.

To detect these individual Cherenkov photons, Photomultiplier tubes are used to amplify the signal from single photons.
This produces an analog voltage pulse that then must be digitized.
As the voltage pulses widths must be \nicetilde{}ns to prevent overlapping with other showers, the digization hardware measures each voltage pulse in 1-nanosecond-wide(??) time bins.
Though faint showers may only posess a few photons, brighter showers can still shine several thousand photons onto individual pixels.
This means that the digization hardware must be able to handle a large dynamic range of inputs, over several orders of magnitude.
To accomplish this, two amplification levels are used in the digization circuit, High Gain for voltage pulses of a few photons, and Low Gain for voltage pulses of several thousand photons.

\subsection{Telescope Pointing}

\begin{figure}[h]

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Like most telescopes, each VERITAS telescope has an immobile base fixed to the ground, and a pointable dish for collecting light.
This dish can rotate in azimuth and in elevation, with enough range in both axes to point at any direction above the horizon.
At their fastest, the telescopes can slew at a rate of 1\degree per second.
To track where the telescopes are pointing, the motors that drive the azimuth and elevation movement have encoders that digitize the pointing direction of the dishes.
However, as the dishes are large metal structures, they bend and flex at different elevations and azimuths.
To account for this flexing, the encoder values are then given to a structural model (??), which accounts for the dish structure bending at different azimuths and elevations.
After applying this model, the telescope pointing can be tracked with an accuracy of 0.013\degree to 0.027\degree \cite{Veritas_Detector}.

As an improvement to the encoder measurement, a Virtual Pointing Monitor (VPM) system is also in place.
The VPM consists of two CCD cameras fixed to each telescope, pointing parallel to the telescope pointing, and a set of LED lights attached to the camera, next to the Winston cones (see section \ref{sec:pmts}).
The first CCD camera is attached below the bottom mirrors, and images the stars in the field of view.
The second CCD camera is attached to the support struts, roughly halfway between the mirrors and the camera, and images the focal plane of the telescope.
Both cameras are visible in figure \ref{fig:davcottel}
During regular observations, these cameras take images of the background stars and the focal plane every two seconds, and (??), resulting in an improved pointing accuracy of \nicetilde 0.0069\degree (originally in griffen thesis 2016, pg45, but is there a better citation??).

As the VERITAS telescopes are based on old designs for a military solar concentrator that sets targets on fire\cite{daviescotton}, the VERITAS telescopes have similar abilities.
This mostly means that care must be taken during the day to point the telescopes away from the sun during maintanance and storage.
% 100m^2 * 1000w/m^2 = 100,000W
If any direct sunlight falls onto the telscope mirrors, the \nicetilde100,000 Watts of light will be concentrated either onto the camera, or a point within a few meters of the camera, which could potentially cause signficant damage to telescope hardware or nearby plants, animals, and people.
VERITAS telescopes are stored during the day by pointing them at \nicetilde0\degree elevation, North.


\subsection{Mirrors}

When cherenkov light first interacts with the telescope array, it is by being reflected by one of 345 mirrors.
These mirrors face towards the incoming cherenkov light, with the PMTs positioned in a camera box, facing the mirrors, shown in figure \ref{fig:davcottel}.
This configuration is referred to as a Davies-Cotton telescope \cite{daviescotton}.
Each mirror has an area of 0.322$m^2$, and a spherical curvature radius of 24m.
The mirrors are each mounted along the support structure so that the total diameter of the telescope mirror area is 12m, with a focal length of 12m, and a total mirror area of 111$m^2$ \cite{Veritas_Detector}.
The mirrors' reflectivity as a function of wavelength is shown in figure \ref{fig:mirreflect}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/mirror_reflect}
    \caption[Mirror Reflectivity]{Mirror reflectivity as a function of wavelength for each telescope, from \cite{mirrorfacets}.  The VERITAS specifications state that the mirror reflectivity must be $\geq 85\%$ between 280nm and 450nm.}\label{fig:mirreflect}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As the mirrors are exposed to the elements, they slowly accumulate dust and scratches.
To combat this, they are cleaned and recoated at regular (yearly??) intervals.
Each mirror is attached to the support structure via three adjustable mounting points, meaning the mirror orientation can be adjusted to point directly on the camera, detailed in \cite{mirroralign}.
This alignment is measured and adjusted at regular intervals, using background stars as a calibration source??.


\subsubsection{Star Point Spread Function}

By pointing a telescope at Polaris and placing a CCD at the focal plane, the mirror PSF can be measured.
This was done with the first VERITAS telescope was built, where the image is shown in figure \ref{fig:mirrorpolaris}.
The mirror psf is 0.06\degree full width half maximum\cite{Veritas_Detector}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/mirror_polaris.eps}
    \caption[Polaris PSF]{Image of Polaris after reflecting off the mirrors, demonstrating the mirror Point Spread Function, from \cite{Veritas_Detector}.  The circle indicates the radius of a PMT.}\label{fig:mirrorpolaris}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Mirror Alignment}
% https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/wiki/index.php/Mirror_Alignment
The mirrors are each mounted to the dish on three adjustable mounting points.
By adjusting the mounting points, the mirrors can be individually aligned.
The alignment procedure is performed by placing a CCD camera at the focal plane, facing towards the mirrors.
The telescope is then pointed towards a magnitude 2 star at \nicetilde70\degree elevation.
The pointing is known as a 'raster' scan of the star, where each mirror's field of view is in turn centered on the star.
By using the CCD to examine the position of the star in each mirror, the mirror's alignment can be calculated and corrected.



\subsection{PMTs}\label{sec:pmts}

Each telescope has a PMT Camera on the end of four supporting arms, inside a protective housing.
This camera consists of 499 Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMTs), each with a Winston cone to increase the light collection area for each PMT.
The PMTs are Hamamatsu's model R10560-100-20 MOD \cite{pmtmodels}.
These winston cones can be seen attached to the PMTs in figure \ref{fig:winstcones}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/winston_cones_t2}
    \caption[Winston Cones]{Hexagonal Winston cones over the circular PMTs, inside the camera housing.}\label{fig:winstcones}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

To operate, the PMTs are connected to high voltage, which is typically around several hundred Volts.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/pmt_models}
    \caption[PMT Models]{The two PMT models used in the VERITAS cameras. \cite{pmtmodels}}\label{fig:pmtmodels}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The PMTs' output signals are first sent through an amplifier, before travelling down a \nicetilde45m (cite??) cable to electronics stationed near the telescope.
The electronics then digitize the signal.

The first circuit that the signal passes through is a Constant Fraction Descriminator (CFD) circuit.
This circuit duplicates the signal voltage pulse from the PMTs, inverts and delays the duplicate pulse, and adds it back to the original pulse.
This combined pulse then crosses the zero-volts threshold (called a Zero Threshold Descriminator) at the same time (how 'same'?? within 1 ns??) as the original pulse reaches its peak, acting as a maximum-voltage detection circuit.
When a maximum voltage is detected by the circuit, it emits a 10ns trigger pulse to other electronics.

The use of this circuit has two main benefits.
The first use is that the CFD circuit will trigger at the same time regardless of the pulse size (??).
If a simple threshold trigger is used to detect a signal pulse, the time of the trigger will be earlier for larger pulses, and later for smaller pulses.
The CFD's zero threshold trigger time is around the time when the signal voltage pulse is at 75\% of its maximum value. (cite??)

The second use is that when the CFD circuit detects a voltage pulse larger than a given maximum threshold, it can emit an extra logic trigger, called a low-gain trigger.
This extra low-gain trigger can then be used by later electronics to determine the rough size of the original signal voltage pulse.

CFD behavior cite??

CFD model??

FADC model??

After the CFD emits a trigger pulse, the signal voltage pulse is passed to another circuit for digization, a Flash Analog-to-Digital Circuit, or FADC.
This FADC circuit then, for each nanosecond time bin, measures how large the voltage pulse is with a series of 255 (??) constant-voltage thresholds.
The highest threshold that is crossed in a single time bin then determines the digital voltage value that is saved to the FADC buffer for that time bin.

If the low-gain trigger pulse was also recieved by the FADC, then the signal voltage pulse is de-amplified before being digitized, since the CFD low-gain threshold is set to lower than the FADC maximum digitizable voltage.
If this low-gain triggering did not take place, then the FADC would become saturated, which effectivly hides how large the voltage pulse actually is.
Once the voltage pulse is digitized, it is saved to a rolling buffer (how long is the buffer??) in the FADC, waiting for other future triggers to occur.

\subsubsection{PMT Upgrade}
In summer of 2012, all PMTs in the telescopes were replaced with improved PMTs.
Specifically, the original Photonis XP2970 models were replaced with the Hamamatsu R10560-100-20 MOD.
This was done because that R10560 has a considerably higher quantum efficiency (\nicetilde$90\%$), compared to the XP2970 (\nicetilde$75\%$).
This higher quantum efficiency means more photons from a shower are detected by the PMT, which means VERITAS is more sensitive to lower energy gamma rays\cite{pmtmodels}.
In addition, the voltage pulse due to a single photoelectron is thinner with the R10560 compared to the XP2970, as shown in figure \ref{fig:pmt_pulse_widths}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/pmt_models_pulsewidths.eps}
    \caption[Pulse Widths]{Pulse widths of the old XP2970 (red circles) and the new R10560 (blue triangles), taken from \cite{pmtmodels}.  Plots are the average of many afterpulses, normalized to the maximum amplitude.  Pulses shown include dispersion due to a \nicetilde55m coaxial cable between the PMTs and the digitizer boards.}\label{fig:pmt_pulse_widths}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The data used in this thesis was taken both before and the upgrade, which means the telescope performance is different for these two time periods.
This is accounted for by separate simulations for each PMT model, mostly resulting in different effective areas at the lower energies.


\subsubsection{PMT Gain Flatfielding}

The VERITAS PMTs are all the same model, but there are still differences from PMT to PMT.
These differences cause the same number of input photons to create differently-shaped output signal voltage pulses.
To account for this, the high voltage of individual(??) PMTs can be varied, so that their pulse shapes are as similar as possible.
Doing this is called Gain Flatfielding.

This is performed by (??)

\subsection{Triggers}\label{sec:trig}

The operation of VERITAS requires digitizing voltage pulses roughly once per nanosecond, per photomultiplier tube.
This means that, with 255 voltage levels, 1 second of raw voltage data would require 2 Terabytes of space.
As this is unfeasable with today's computing systems, only subsets of the raw pixel voltages are saved when certain triggers are met.
To complicate matters, photons from atmospheric muons and the night sky background can also cause voltage pulses similar to a gamma ray shower.
Thus, VERITAS has a system of triggers that reduces the amount of raw data that is saved, while also partially filtering out non-gamma-ray events.

The L1 is the first and lowest level trigger.
An L1 trigger (sometimes called a pixel trigger) is emitted when a PMT's CFD circuit detects a signal voltage above a given threshold, typically in the 10s of mV.
This threshold voltage is varied throughout datataking by a rate-feedback system (elaborate more??).
The L1 trigger is emitted at the point in time when the voltage pulse is approximatly 75\% of its maximum (??).
Once emitted, the L1 trigger is sent to a per-telescope FPGA(??) circuit board for the next level trigger.

The FPGA's L2 trigger, or image trigger, is emitted by the FPGA when a group of L1 triggers meet certain conditions.
These conditions include that multiple L1 triggers fall within a certain time window, and that multiple L1 triggers come from one of several predefined shapes, or templates.
The coincident time window varies. (elaborate??)
There are several patterns. (elaborate??)
The pattern requirements help reduce the number of triggers from non-gamma-ray sources.
Night sky background photons are only able to trigger individual pixels, and muons tend to create ring-shaped images.
Once one of these patterns occurs in a time window, the FPGA emits an L2 trigger, which is sent to the array trigger system.

The array trigger system, or L3, is a computer (box?? circuit??), which looks for coincident L2 triggers that fall within a \nicetilde50ns time window.
Why 50ns??
This window is also varied for each telescope based on the azimuth and elevation of the pointing, as these can introduce nanosecond delays between images.
During a typical observation period, the L3 trigger rate is around 200-300Hz.

Once an L3 trigger is invoked, a signal is sent to all telescopes (all or just L2-triggered telescopes??) that the digitized voltages for all pixels in the cameras should be read out from their buffers, and saved to memory.
These pixel voltages are then processed by the analysis software to reconstruct the gamma ray events.



\subsubsection{Deadtime}
When the L3 trigger is invoked and the buffers are being read out, the electronics are unable to store new PMT voltages in the buffers.
Being unable to store new PMT voltages effectivly reduces the amount of time spent observing gamma rays.
This lost time is usually referred to as deadtime.
As the deadtime is a fixed (is it fixed??) time loss per event, the percent of time lost due to event readout rises with the a higher frequency of readouts.
This means that at an L3 trigger rate of \nicetilde300Hz, approximately \nicetilde12\% of the time is lost due to buffer readouts.

Since the L3 rate varies over the course of a run, this means that the deadtime also varies.
This is accounted for in the flux calculation in section ??.

\subsubsection{Time Pedestal Calibration}
As all PMTs and signal cables are not identical, there are differences in how long a voltage pulse takes to travel.
More specifically, the time between a) when the photon strikes the PMT cathode ?? and b) when the voltage pulse sets off its L1 trigger, can vary from pixel to pixel.
This is usually measured by looking at the average arrival time of many events over all camera pixels.
By looking at the average arrival time, pixels that are consistanly early or late can be accounted for, which improves image identification.

\subsection{Epochs}\label{sec:epochs}
After being built, VERITAS has evolved over several years, with collaboration members upgrading it to improve performance.
However, these major differences need to be taken into account in the analysis chain.
To organize these differences, in the data they are referred to as epochs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (usually denoted as V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6).

As the first three telescopes were constructed and brought online, data taken after each is the first, second, and third epochs.
Telescope 1 was placed at (-37.6, -23.7), telescope 2 at (44.1, -47.7), and telescope 3 at (29.4,60.1), where the coordinate system's origin is at 31.675N, 110.962W??, the X axis points East, and the Y axis points North, and both axes are in meters(??).
In 2007, the fourth telescope was finished at (-35.9,11.3), and data taken between this point in time and the next major upgrade is considered the fourth epoch.

In September 2009, telescope 1 was moved to a new position (135.4,-8.61), after it was demonstrated with simulations that it would grant a \nicetilde30\% improvement in sensitivity \cite{veritas_t1_move}.
Data taken after this relocation is referred to as the fifth epoch.

In August 2012, the PMTs in all cameras were replaced with improved PMTs that had a higher quantum efficiency, improving the telescopes ability to resolve images\cite{pmtmodels}.
Data taken after this upgrade is considered part of the sixth epoch.

As these different epochs have different telescope configurations, the instrument response functions are different, meaning each epoch behaves in a quantifiably distinct manner.
For the Dark Matter analysis described in this thesis, only data from the fifth and sixth epochs are used.
