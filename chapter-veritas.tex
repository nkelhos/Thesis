\section{Observatory}

VERITAS is a Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope.
It consists of 4 telescopes, spaced roughly 50m apart from each other.
Each telescope consists of an array of 499 mirrors, and a 499 Photomultiplier Tube camera out on a boom.
Each mirror focuses gathered photons onto a separate pixel in the camera.


\section{Hardware}

4 telescopes
499 pmt's per pixel
~1000V

\section{Triggers}
L1 for pixel
L2 for telescope image
L3 for multi-telescope event : ~300Hz

As the telescope points at a lower elevation, the atmospheric volume that can be used to detect air showers greatly increases, leading to an increase in the telescope's effective areafor high energy showers.
The downside is that fewer low-energy gamma rays reach the volume of atmosphere being observed,
