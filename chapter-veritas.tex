\section{Observatory}

VERITAS is a Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope.
It consists of 4 telescopes, spaced roughly 50m apart from each other.
Each telescope consists of an array of 499 mirrors, and a 499 Photomultiplier Tube camera out on a boom.
Each mirror focuses gathered photons onto a separate pixel in the camera.


\section{Hardware}

4 telescopes
499 pmt's per pixel
~1000V

\section{Triggers}
L1 for pixel
L2 for telescope image
L3 for multi-telescope event : ~300Hz

\section{Sensitivity}

Sensitivity is a measure of how difficult it is to get a signifiant detection.
Usually it is measured in 'hours of observation to detect an example point source at 3 sigma'

\section{Effective Area}

Effective area is the measure of how many gamma rays a telescope can detect.
It is referred to as 'Effective' because the detection efficiency is not 100\% at all energies or all parts of the camera.
Instead it is 'effectivly' how large a detection area a telescope has, if it had perfect detection efficiency.
Different telescopes can use this number to compare roughly how many gamma rays can be detected in a given span of time.

\section{Energy Resolution}

Gamma rays and protons of different energies can produce similar-looking air showers.
Due to this, the reconstruction software cannot perfectly reconstruct gamma rays, which introduces errors into the different qualities of the gamma rays.
This means that when a gamma ray is reconstructed, it has a chance to be reconstructed at a lower or higher energy.
The consequence of this is that gamma rays of a given reconstructed energy can come from a distribution of true simulated energies.
Typically, simulations are run across a number of energies, and an 2D matrix is assembled, where one axis is the true simulated energy, and the other axis is bins of reconstructed energy.


\section{Point Spread Function}

In addition to the energy being slightly mis-reconstructed, the source position of the gamma ray can also be misreconstructed.
For a gamma ray telescope, a simple measure is to simulate at a single point in the sky, and look at how the reconstructed positions are distributed around that point.
This distribution is referred to as the Point Spread Function.
To first order, most current-generation point spread functions are gaussian distributions.


\section{Energy Sensitivity and Zenith Angle}

As the telescope points at a lower elevation, the atmospheric volume that can be used to detect air showers greatly increases, leading to an increase in the telescope's effective areafor high energy showers.
The downside is that fewer low-energy gamma rays reach the volume of atmosphere being observed,
