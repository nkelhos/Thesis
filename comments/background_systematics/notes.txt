Combining all runs (crude):

  Simulations of the background data result in a ~5% statistical error in the background model at 0.5 and 0.7 deg from camera center (where GC is in the camera).
  Error climbed to ~20% at 0 deg, and ~10% at 0.1 deg from camera center, due to smaller solid angle in the inner rings resulting in fewer events.

Splitting up based on epoch (more correct)
  V5 : 5% at 0.5deg, 3% at 0.7deg (output.v7_onlyV5runs)
  V6 : 5% at 0.5deg, 5% at 0.7deg (output.v8_onlyV6runs)
